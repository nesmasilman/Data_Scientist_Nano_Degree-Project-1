### Introduction
Since 2008, guests and hosts have used Airbnb to travel in a more unique, personalized way. As part of the Airbnb Inside initiative, this project will explore the dataset that describes the listing activity of homestays in Boston, MA.

### Scope
By exploring this dataset, we will be looking for answers for the below 3 questions:

1- Extract the listings with the highest # of reviews (top 10). Which one got the highest % of positive reviews?

2- What are the top 3 most frequent neighbourhoods or zipcodes in Boston? (zipcodes with highest number of listings).

3- How the price correlates to the property_type? What types are the most expensive?

### Datasets
The Zipfile contains 3 csv files

* Listings: including full descriptions and average review score
* Reviews: including unique id for each reviewer and detailed comments
* Calendar: including listing id and the price and availability for that day
  
### Technologies
This project uses Python 3.10.9 version
